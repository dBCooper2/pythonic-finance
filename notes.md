# Presenting this Repo

Make this simpler, add summary notebooks to each chapter. This is so I have something to send to people that aren't as technical so they're actually engaged with the content instead of glazing over the latex and skipping my work. Additionally, this will give me some help on creating articles and writing about my work.

How to do this:

- Go deeper on Data Viz: Learn some more techniques to make graphs pop and make the jupyter notebooks focus on just the Viz(Put functions in a separate library and pull them)
