# Pythonic Finance - Financial Analysis in Python

This repository is a catch-all for notes, programs and algorithms for financial analysis in Python and iPython. I will be taking notes on the Textbook _Statistics and Data Analysis for Financial Engineering with R examples_, and use it as a reference to learn about financial engineering and translate it into Python code and iPython notebooks.

## Table of Contents(Links will be added later)

- Calculating Returns
- Modeling Univariate and Multivariate Statistical Models
- Regression Models
- Time Series Models
- GARCH Models
- Portfolio Selection
- Capital Asset Pricing Model
