# Pythonic Finance - Financial Engineering/Analysis in Python

Statistical Analysis of Equities using Time Series Models, Regression, the Capital Asset Pricing Model(CAPM), and the Fama French 3-Factor and 5-Factor Models in Python and iPython Notebooks.

I will be taking notes on the Textbook _Statistics and Data Analysis for Financial Engineering with R examples_, and use it as a reference to learn about financial engineering and translate it into Python code and iPython notebooks.

## Python Scripts

Scripts will be written as/after I finish sections of the textbook, and will focus on Object-Oriented representations of the finance topics covered in the Jupyter/iPython Notebooks

If you are interested in previous projects I have written that cover similar topics, please take a look at:

[CAPM](https://github.com/dBCooper2/financial-modeling/blob/main/notebooks/finance/capm.ipynb) and [Fama-French](https://github.com/dBCooper2/financial-modeling/blob/main/notebooks/finance/fama-french.ipynb) Beta Estimation in Jupyter Notebooks

## Jupyter/iPython Notebooks

### _Textbook Notes:_ [Calculating Returns](notebooks/financial_data/returns_textbook_notes.ipynb)

<img src="docs/readme_files/returns_chapter/amd_log_returns.png" alt="amd_log" style="width: 85%;"/>

This notebook examines the calculation of Net, Gross and Log Returns of an asset, along with how and why they are used. Included is a comparison of 3 semiconductor equities, ADI, AMAT and AMD, as well as a simple time series for each stock's logarithmic returns over a 5-year period.

### _Textbook Notes:_ [Examining Distributions](notebooks/time_series/notebooks/time_series/exploratory_data_analysis__textbook.ipynb)

### _Python Exercises:_ [Examining Distributions with Histograms and Kernel Density Estimates](notebooks/time_series/exploratory_data_analysis__python_hists_kde.ipynb)

<img src="/docs/readme_files/time_series_data_analysis_chapter/hists_kde.png" alt="dists_compared"/>

This notebook covers histograms and kernel density estimates for examining sample distributions. Included are histograms and Gaussian KDE's of the semiconductor equity APH, implemented using matplotlib and KDEPy.

### _Python Exercises:_ [Examining Distributions and Testing for Normality](notebooks/time_series/exploratory_data_analysis__python_sample_analysis.ipynb)

<img src="/docs/readme_files/time_series_data_analysis_chapter/normal_probability_plots.png" alt="normprobplots"/>

This notebook covers testing for normality with samples of asset prices: Sample Quantiles, and Tests of Normality including the Shapiro-Wilk Test are some of the functions in this notebook; The plots covered are Box Plots, Normal Probability Plots, Half-Normal Plots, and Quantile-Quantile Plots.
