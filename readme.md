# Pythonic Finance - Financial Analysis in Python

Statistical Analysis of Equities using Time Series Models, Regression, the Capital Asset Pricing Model(CAPM), and the Fama French 3-Factor and 5-Factor Models in Python and iPython Notebooks.

I will be taking notes on the Textbook _Statistics and Data Analysis for Financial Engineering with R examples_, and use it as a reference to learn about financial engineering and translate it into Python code and iPython notebooks.

## Python Scripts

Scripts are still a TODO, and will focus on Object-Oriented representations of the finance topics covered in the Jupyter/iPython Notebooks

## Jupyter/iPython Notebooks

### Table of Contents(Links will be added as I cover the material)
